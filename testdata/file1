About

A natural language parser is a program that works out the grammatical structure of sentences, for instance, which groups of words go together (as "phrases") and which words are the subject or object of a verb. Probabilistic parsers use knowledge of language gained from hand-parsed sentences to try to produce the most likely analysis of new sentences. These statistical parsers still make some mistakes, but commonly work rather well. Their development was one of the biggest breakthroughs in natural language processing in the 1990s. You can try out our parser online.
Package contents

This package is a Java implementation of probabilistic natural language parsers, both highly optimized PCFG and lexicalized dependency parsers, and a lexicalized PCFG parser. The original version of this parser was mainly written by Dan Klein, with support code and linguistic grammar development by Christopher Manning. Extensive additional work (internationalization and language-specific modeling, flexible input/output, grammar compaction, lattice parsing, k-best parsing, typed dependencies output, user support, etc.) has been done by Roger Levy, Christopher Manning, Teg Grenager, Galen Andrew, Marie-Catherine de Marneffe, Bill MacCartney, Anna Rafferty, Spence Green, Huihsin Tseng, Pi-Chuan Chang, Wolfgang Maier, and Jenny Finkel.

The lexicalized probabilistic parser implements a factored product model, with separate PCFG phrase structure and lexical dependency experts, whose preferences are combined by efficient exact inference, using an A* algorithm. Or the software can be used simply as an accurate unlexicalized stochastic context-free grammar parser. Either of these yields a good performance statistical parsing system. A GUI is provided for viewing the phrase structure tree output of the parser.

As well as providing an English parser, the parser can be and has been adapted to work with other languages. A Chinese parser based on the Chinese Treebank, a German parser based on the Negra corpus and Arabic parsers based on the Penn Arabic Treebank are also included. The parser has also been used for other languages, such as Italian, Bulgarian, and Portuguese.

The parser provides Universal Dependencies and Stanford Dependencies output as well as phrase structure trees. Typed dependencies are otherwise known grammatical relations. This style of output is available only for English and Chinese. For more details, please refer to the Stanford Dependencies webpage and the Universal Dependencies documentation.
Shift-reduce constituency parser

As of version 3.4 in 2014, the parser includes the code necessary to run a shift reduce parser, a much faster constituent parser with competitive accuracy. Models for this parser are linked below.
Neural-network dependency parser

In version 3.5.0 (October 2014) we released a high-performance dependency parser powered by a neural network. The parser outputs typed dependency parses for English and Chinese. The models for this parser are included in the general Stanford Parser models package.
Dependency scoring

The package includes a tool for scoring of generic dependency parses, in a class edu.stanford.nlp.trees.DependencyScoring. This tool measures scores for dependency trees, doing F1 and labeled attachment scoring. The included usage message gives a detailed description of how to use the tool.
Usage notes

The current version of the parser requires Java 8 (JDK1.8) or later. (You can also download an old version of the parser, version 1.4, which runs under JDK 1.4, version 2.0 which runs under JDK 1.5, version 3.4.1 which runs under JDK 1.6, but those distributions are no longer supported.) The parser also requires a reasonable amount of memory (at least 100MB to run as a PCFG parser on sentences up to 40 words in length; typically around 500MB of memory to be able to parse similarly long typical-of-newswire sentences using the factored model).

The parser is available for download, licensed under the GNU General Public License (v2 or later). Source is included. The package includes components for command-line invocation, a Java parsing GUI, and a Java API.

The download is a 261 MB zipped file (mainly consisting of included grammar data files). If you unpack the zip file, you should have everything needed. Simple scripts are included to invoke the parser on a Unix or Windows system. For another system, you merely need to similarly configure the classpath.
Licensing

The parser code is dual licensed (in a similar manner to MySQL, etc.). Open source licensing is under the full GPL, which allows many free uses. For distributors of proprietary software, commercial licensing is available. (Fine print: The traditional (dynamic programmed) Stanford Parser does part-of-speech tagging as it works, but the newer constituency and neural network dependency shift-reduce parsers require pre-tagged input. For convenience, we include the part-of-speech tagger code, but not models with the parser download. However, if you want to use these parsers under a commercial license, then you need a license to both the Stanford Parser and the Stanford POS tagger. Or you can get the whole bundle of Stanford CoreNLP.) If you don't need a commercial license, but would like to support maintenance of these tools, we welcome gift funding: use this form and write "Stanford NLP Group open source software" in the Special Instructions.

Questions about the parser?

    If you're new to parsing, you can start by running the GUI to try out the parser. Scripts are included for linux (lexparser-gui.sh) and Windows (lexparser-gui.bat).
    Take a look at the Javadoc lexparser package documentation and LexicalizedParser class documentation. (Point your web browser at the index.html file in the included javadoc directory and navigate to those items.)
    Look at the parser FAQ for answers to common questions.

Sample input and output

The parser can read various forms of plain text input and can output various analysis formats, including part-of-speech tagged text, phrase structure trees, and a grammatical relations (typed dependency) format. For example, consider the text:

    The strongest rain ever recorded in India shut down the financial hub of Mumbai, snapped communication lines, closed airports and forced thousands of people to sleep in their offices or walk home during the night, officials said today.

The following output shows part-of-speech tagged text, then a context-free phrase structure grammar representation, and finally a typed dependency representation. All of these are different views of the output of the parser.

    The/DT strongest/JJS rain/NN ever/RB recorded/VBN in/IN India/NNP
    shut/VBD down/RP the/DT financial/JJ hub/NN of/IN Mumbai/NNP ,/,
